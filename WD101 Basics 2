Big picture

1. The user acts

	Precondition: The browser has loaded a wepage and interpreted the webpage's Javascript code.

	What happens: The user interacts with some element on a webpage, or some other time-sensitive event is triggered while the webpage is open.

	Examples: Clicking a link, typing into a search ield, hovering the mouse over an element, scrolling to the end of a page.

2. The browser reacts

	Precondition: Some kind of event has been triggered, by time elapsed or user interaction.

	What happens: The browser acts according to the webpage's javascript instructions. For our purposes, the action is formulating a request to send to the server.

	Examples: If the user has filled out a form, the browser collects teh information in the fields, parses it, and creates an appropriate request for the webpage server. Or, every 30 seconds that the browser is open, it formulates a request to ask the web server if any new tweets/notifications have happened since the previous request for updates.

3. The browser sends request to server

	Precondition: The browser has formulated a reqeust to send to the server

	What happens: The browser sends the request

	Examples: Asking for the webpage at a URL that was clicked on by the user.
