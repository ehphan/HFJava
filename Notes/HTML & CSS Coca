HTML & CSS Coca

HTML: HyperText Markup Language
HyperText: text with links in it.

A Markup language is a programming language used to make text do more than just sit on a page: it can turn text into images, links, tables, lists, and much more. HTML is the markup language we'll be learning.

CSS: Cascading Style Sheets.
	Think of it like skin and makeup that covers the bones of HTML

a. Always put <!DOCTYPE html> on the first line. This tells the browser what language it's reading.
b. Always put <html> on the next line. This starts the HTML document.
c. Always put </html> on the last line. This ends the HTML document.

Basic Terminology
	1. Things inside <>s are called tags.
	2. Tags nearly always come in pairs: opening tag and a closing tag.
		opening: <html> closing </html>

	Think of tags like parentheses: whenever you open one, you should close it. Tags also nest, so you should close them in the right order: the most recently opened tag should be the first one closed.

Make the head
	There are always two parts to an HTML file: the head and the body. Let's start with the head.

	The head contains information about your HTML file, like its title. The title is what we see in the browser's title bar or page tab. For example the title of this page is "HTML Basics | Codecademy"

	The body is where you put your content, text,images, and links.

Headings

	HTML lets us have more than one heading size. 6 heading sizes, <h1> is boss. <h6> a bitch.

	<a href="www.google.com">
		link
	</a>

Ordered Lists
	<ol> </ol> tags
	we then wrap each individual item in <li> </li> tags

		<ol>
			<li>kill it</li>
			<li>stab it</li>
			<li>maul it</li>
			<li>burn it</li>
		</ol>

Styling text
	<p>Whatever Text</p> becomes
	<p style="color:green; font-size:16px">Whatever Text</p>

Font family
	changing font by using font-family
	<p style="font-family: Arial">Whatever Text</p>
