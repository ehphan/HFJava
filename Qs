Qs

Give me a method getFile() that reads a FileThing.txt

	void getFile() {
		try {
			File file = new File("FileThing.txt");
			BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));
		} catch (Exception ex) {ex.printStackTrace();}
	}

What is the main point of generics? When is it used generally?
	It lets you write type-safe collections. Most code you write that deals with generics will be collection-related code.

To use a TreeSet, what do you need to be true(either)?
	1.The elements in the list must be of a type that implements Comparable
		class Book implements Comparable
	2. You use the TreeSet's overloaded constructor that takes a Comparator.
		public class myCompare implements Comparator<myObj>
		TreeSet<myObj> tree = new TreeSet<myObj>(myCompare);
